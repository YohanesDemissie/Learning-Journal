Today I learned how to insert an image and the professional method of it. <img> is the image element followed by src="images/quokka.jpg". You can also put an alternatie caption on it in case the imgae doesnt load propperly on certain browswers like so alt="A family of quokka". And also a or caption that looks like this. title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." All together a properly posted image should look like this in HTML <img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." />
