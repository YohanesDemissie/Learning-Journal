#Learning Journal
Today I learned a lot about heroku and its benefits
I learned how to link git hub with heroku so it alwasy has my latest ACP's.
I learned how to set up heroku on my local drive by runmning EACH of the following code one at a time into ternminal within directory that has server.js
Step 1: export PORT=3000
Step 2: export CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:8080
Step 3 for Mac:     export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/books_app
Step 3 for Windows: export DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/books_app

then run the following in the terminal: heroku create gn-yd-booklist

I learned how to ACP Heroku style with the following line within my terminal: git push heroku branch_name

And to Automatically sync git ACP's: Hit deploy tab, connect github, select organization from drop down menu, search repo name and connect!
