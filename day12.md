#Learning Journal Day 12

Today I learned about application storage. I learned about audio and video elements. I learned about libraries starting with charts.js. I learned how to display a graph in my javascript and display the outcome of a function. I Learned about the benefit of group work and a couple variables that make a team most effective like empathy, open mindedness, equal input, emotional intelligence, etc. Most of all I'm learning to adaptive to the learning methods of a developer. Pushing my limits, learning to be resourceful, working with others and understanding new material.
