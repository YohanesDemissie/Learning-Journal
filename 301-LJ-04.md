Today I learned about hadnlebars with most of my understanding from Scots lecture and this online resource http://handlebarsjs.com/ that I bookmarked for futrure reference. Handlebars are an easier way to create elements by id like we learned in 201 and dynamically function them using libraries called jquery. This is the website I use as a reference to utilize handlebars in jquery https://oscarotero.com/jquery/. ALWAYS MAKE SURE jquery cdn is pasted into the script tag in index.html before all other javascript script tags.
