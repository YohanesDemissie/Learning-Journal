Learning Journal

Wednesday November 8, 2017

Today I learned how a lot of functions. I learned how to prompt questionnaires with limited trials. I learned how to tally questions answers at the end of the questionnaires. I learned to create custom prompts based on users input. I learned to create a guessing game stored within an array. I also had a little more practice utilizing the terminal; changing directories, utilizing "ls" and pushing directories into repositories. I understand a about the branch and master system but will know more about it with experience.

Today I learned how to place loops into functions and make the functions work. I'm not sure why we did this since it just added more code and didn't change anything. But knowing Scott I'm sure it'll play a valuable role in advance functions later on. I learned how to share repositories with teammates, edit files, re upload them as a branch and merge with the master origin. Me and my teammates broke down the process and took notes of the process I plan on sharing with the rest of the class for future reference. Not necessarily a learning curb but I gained good experience with git hub and terminal as well.
