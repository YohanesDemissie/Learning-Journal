#Learning Journal 02
Today I learned how to dynamically hide when a tab is selected and only show the content withing the selected tabt through an event handler in the index.

We didnt complete the assignment which I'm comfortable with. I rather move slowly and get a concrete grasp of the assignment, digesting every step of progress rather than rush and turn in something I barely understand, just for the grade. With that being said I'm glad to have a partner like Jordan for this lab who feels the same way.

I'm also getting more comfortable with riding the struggle bus with patience. I'm becoming resourceful, social asking the right questions and utlizing google more accurately and efficiently.
