#Day 34 Part 1 Styling with Vanilla CSS
<form class="main-form" novalidate>
novalidate validates diredtly in the form. like when creating an email address and making sure the user has a @ .com characters before they even sugmit anything
margin pushes outwards
padding pushes inwards

#Part One 2nd Half Gets Crazy With Vanilla CSS

input[type] input[type="value"] input[class="prices"]
the first selects an attribute
the 2nd selects and attribute with a value
3rd selects class attribute and its specific class

#Part 2: 301 UI Challenge (Sprites)
<div class="container">
  <label for="validated-input">Text Input with form validation</label>
  <input id="validate-inpuput" type="text" placeholder="yohanes" patterm="use regex to regulate user input" required>
  <label>Please enter valid username</label>
</div>

#CSSfile
#validated-input {
  border: 1px solid grey;
  border-radius: 0;
  padding: 1.75vw;
}

#validate-input:focus {
  outline:none
}

.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 4vw
}

.container label {
  dislplay: block;
  font-weight: bold;
  padding: 2vw 0;
}

#input-error {
  visibility: hidden
  position: absolute;
  font-size: 2vw;
  right: -68%;
}

#validated-input:not(:placeholder-shown):invalid { this allows us to show a red border on the placeholder if the usre input is incorrect
  border: 3px;
}

Dispatch updates the Redux Store through requests of functions and store responses indeiractly to dispatch

req, res next ==> store, next, action

redux allowa the dev to control what responses are dipatched once the request is successfully made form the dipatch to the redux store

console.group()
console.info()
console.end()
