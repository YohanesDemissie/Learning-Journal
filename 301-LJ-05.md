Today I learned how to create handlevars amd implement cdn source into my html. I had more practice witho this completing the weekend lab 5 assignment where I created input forms for a user to add title, author, description and other article content. Although I havent completed the entire thing, I'm very close to making it render newly implemented user data to the database and show in the browser.
