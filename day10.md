#Learning journal
Today I learned my strength in CSS and HTML. I had a really hard time with javascript over the week and felt really behind and not up to par with the class expectations. Today I was the driver and naturally took over the assignment. I was really good at customizing placement, size and format of our website. I was very innovative with manipulating tags I knew and making them do what was necessary since I didn't have much time to look up the actual/efficient code that would do the same thing. I learned that I love CSS and HTML more than everyone I spoke with in class. I learned front-end work is definitely the path I want to take into a professional career.
