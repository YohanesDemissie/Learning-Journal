#Learning Journal 8

Today I learned about SQL and how to it works. I got some good practice  on https://sqlbolt.com/ site. I really enjoy SQL cause its the most straight forward and easy to read language we've learned so far. I learned how to create a new table like so...
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_name(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, column_name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL, column_2 VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL);

From the newly created columns, I learned to add rows full of content like so...

SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id=1
INSERT INTO table_name(column_name, column_2)
VALUES(â€˜John Snow, Game of Thrones);

I can repeat the steps above to cnotinuously add content to my table
