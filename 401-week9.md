#################O-Auth NOTES AND BREAK DOWN############
#O-Auth Route
1. client lg in page sends an "anchor" to googles login front end
2. google front end connects with googles back-end which sends authentication back to the front end
3. (a) Googles backend connects with our backend
3. (b) our backend sends code to googles backend 
3. (c) google gives our backend an authorized token
4. the user is given a token based off their google account that communicates with our backend throughout the users application experince and re-routes, giving them authorized access throught our application
5. the user now can create an account on our application
6. When steps 1-5 our successfully completed the user now has an access token to use our application

#Connecting Front End To Back
thorugh our .env files, we pasted in our back end GOOGLE_AUTH_ID to our front end html file 

#OVERVIEW
re-watch 41.3 around 6 minutes explaining id scope and other details about google API and DOCS

###################LOAD TESTER NOTES#################
#Testing user usage capacity on an application
Re-watch lecture video part 2 on json file understanding how it connects to our js file and

#.json File OverView
arrival rate allows you to input how many users (usage) you want to test for

our "capture" moment in .json file captures the token from the user signing in or signing up and renders that token...

our first Post request creates the users profile by username email and password

2nd post request creates the profile according to the users name, and email

#arrival rate
alter the arrival-rate number to increase and decrease your user usage to find the exact breaking point

arrival rate is the user rate over duration(how many users)
so arrival rate at 100 and duration at 5 is 100 users per 5 seconds

user faker uuid
math.random for randomizing numbers or ID's
look into other randomizing libraries to test for applications efficiently

#DEPLOYMENT
paste in your URL in "target": "" in .json file WITHOUT a trailing "/" at the end

#Lab
test for signup and a user event like creating a profile, uploading a picture, etc.

#########################HEAPS AND GRAPHS NOTES###########################
#PART 1
Heaps: finding the greatest and smallest value in a binary tree
Breadth first rewriting graph into an array
Big O(n)

#Node terminology
K is the root
Left: 2k + 1
Right: 2k + 2
Big O(n)

in a binary tree, each branch is 4 bytes of memory and the leaves them self are an additional 4 bytes each. This is why people re-iterate the values of a tree into an array
Big O(n)

#Part 2 Graphs
branches/links/edges = all mean the same thing but edges is the more computer science term
Graphs have no head root. It starts and ends anywhere depending on the situation or end goal of using the database
Graphs would most likely be used for friends requests, neuro-networking friends requests
Almost every computer network is built off graphs

findPath(start, end) is how we would define the start and end node as arguments and let the computer graph the most efficient route between the nodes

#Graph Terminology
Directed:
Indirect:
Loop: continuous(infinite) looping between nodes
Node Vertex:
Path: the nodes between (start, end) in findPath(start, end)
Cycle: is a path that starts and ends in the same node
Connected Graph: creating branch/link/edge between one node to the other on 2 separate graphs
Neighbor/Connections: path length of one, from one node to the next. Direction of edge plays important factor. Neighbor is only qualified if the edge direction is in the direction of the next node(s)
Simple Graph: No weights(because the standard edge/branch has a wight of 4 bytes each) no direction, no loops, no multiple edges

A tree is a prime example of a simple graph except that it has direction

#LAB
we will use a hash map to grab a node and iterate through all the connected nodes into a linked list
SET is a hash map that just grabs the keys and not the values

#Part 3
rewatch video to fix code confusion
re-watch for tests
re-watch for add nodes and then ading edges to create our graph specifically how we want the nodes to connect
