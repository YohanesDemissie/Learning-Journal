#learning journal
Today I learned about web layout. I learned that websites are made of 16 vertical columns. I learned when you're using any less than 16 vertical columns, the remaining columns are referred to as "offset" columns. I learned box-sizing: border box; code allows us to push boxes from the border not from padding and margin to push against surrounding elements.
width: calc( 100% /3 ); is a new code I learned from lecture that pretty much means youâ€™ll have 2 content boxes and the third spacing will be distributes among the rest. And I remember Scott using this code margin-left: calc (( 100% / 3 ) / 3 )); which I think splits the last remaining third spacing into thirds again. I also gained a lot of experience using CSS (finally!) but definitely underestimated the time and effort it takes to make a nice, pretty, organized and custom website using CSS. I thought I would have been done before 6pm and am currently still working on it. I'm definitely rusty from first using code academy and learned to respect the time I have with an assignment no matter how confident I may be.
