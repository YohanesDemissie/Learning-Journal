#Learning Journal Day 11


Overall, it didn't go at all lol I did a lot of trial and error, using codes I found online, using content from the book and lectures and trying to work with others. I feel like I have great ideas and gather all the right pieces but just CANNOT put them together in a functional matter. Especially with the limited time given.

I still get confused on where to place .this and .prototype sometimes. I get confused on exactly what function to call and when. I don't even know what to ask. Everything makes sense in lecture but actually creating functions, objects and methods from scratch, correctly and in a working matter is where I fall short.

I have not completed the project. I'm hoping to find actual guidance and thorough structure from beginning to end when learning libraries tomorrow and really hope I can really grasp this part of javascript because it's the only part of this course that's really holding me back.
