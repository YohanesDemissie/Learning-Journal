#Learning Journal week 8
this week I really enjoyed the cfgram assignemnt. More specifically how to upload photos to a database and render them to the DOM. Just covering the basics of creating a social network profile page was really eciting for me. 
Here I took note of how to run our database, run our back-end and run our front end thorugh terminal commands with a few mongo commands as well.
#Front-End
RUN FRONT END
npm run watch


#Back-End
RUN MONGO SHELL
mongo

RUN MONGO DATABASE
npm run start-db

npm run stop-db

RUN SERVER
npm run start:watch

#MONGO-DB
PULL UP DATABASE
user cfgram

db.user.find().pretty()
