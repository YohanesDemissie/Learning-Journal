Today I learned one of the greatest lessons of being a software developer; resilience. I was heavily thinking about swithcing to weekends and evening calsses becasue I felt so behind. I thought even heavier on dropping out completely. I've been behind since monday and felt so far behind my classmates. But after talking to them, TA's and other code-fellows students, I gained my second wind and kept at it. in the passed 24 hours I went from dwelling in self-doubt, to being almost COMPLETELY caught up, actually understanding the material and feeling like I''m on top of the world! I gained a valuable lesson in tenacity and a new level of strength in consistency. Its been a great day today and I will be sleeping well tonight knowing I CAN be a software developer!
